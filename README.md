# CMM_Challenge
CoverMyMeds challenge held at the Erdös Institute, May of 2022.

## Overview
### Problem Context

Companies like CoverMyMeds have access to a large quantity of pharmacy transaction data. Our goal is to extrapolate from this data information about the expenses that patients should expect to see at the pharmacy, which is relevant to the patients as well as healthcare providers.

The expenses that patients actually pay for prescription drugs are determined by complicated interactions between drug manufacturers, insurance companies, and pharmacies. While official coverage information from insurance companies, as well as information about manufacturer discount programs, can be difficult to track down, data about individual transactions is abundant. For example, the dataset provided by CoverMyMeds for this project is simulated to model such real-world data sets. 

The purpose of our project is to predict patients’ out-of-pocket pay and drugs’ formulary status for each insurance plan, directly from a large database of transaction data.
This helps patients save money on prescriptions, and also helps doctors to make an informed decision about medication costs when prescribing medications.
